## Tips
try to use low resolution images with high contrast. There is a resizer in the code that can be adjusted to change the resolution of the ascii art. 
play around with the different ascii presets at the top of the page, some are better for dark backgrounds and others are better with light background.
feel free to make your own ascii preset just know that custom characters will likely not work with this code.
