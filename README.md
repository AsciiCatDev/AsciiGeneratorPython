# Welcome to the world of Ascii Art!
#Welcome to the Ascii Cult

## HOW TO USE
* upload the folder into the IDE of your choice
* upload either a jpg file or mp4 file to the img folder
* open either AsciiVideo or AsciiImage file
* change the file name to the one you want to convert 
* click run and follow the steps
* enjoy your master piece

## Tips
Try to use low resolution images with high contrast. There is a resizer in the code that can be adjusted to change the resolution of the ascii art. 
play around with the different ascii presets at the top of the page, some are better for dark backgrounds and others are better with light backgrounds.
Feel free to make your own ascii preset just know that custom characters will likely not work with this code.
